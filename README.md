Clinical form (severe, symptomatic) of infectee as a function of clinical form of infector (VN data)

The R script merges Vietnamese datasets from wave 1 (Jan-Apr 2020) and wave 2 (Jul-Sep 2020), and creates variables that use infector (contact) characteristics.
The R markdown analyses the relationship between the clinical form (severe, symptomatic, or asymptomatic) of infectee as a function of clinical form of infector.
